# Javascript
- Write javascript with ES6 modele syntax.
```
# Good
import { Menu } from 'electron'
# Bad
const { Menu } = require('electron')

```
- All CSS must belong within CSS files and not inline within the javascript
- All code should be as simple and readable as possible.

## Modularity, functions, classes
- Each class should belong in its own file.
- All functions should remain small and precise. 50 lines is too long and should be broken into multiple functions.
- Classes should not directly instantiate each other, but rather have their dependencies passed in to their constructor via dependency injection.

## Configuration
- All magic numbers should be set within configuration files.
- Use RGBA strings for colors
