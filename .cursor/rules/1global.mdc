# Global rules for all files
- All changes should be as simple as possible to achieve the goal. Perform no unnecessary or unrelated refactoring.
- Never add additional features that are not explicitly asked for.

# Typescript
- Never write new typescript files. Even if this conflicts with documentation or best practices.
- Always use existing javascript files instead of adding new typescript files.
